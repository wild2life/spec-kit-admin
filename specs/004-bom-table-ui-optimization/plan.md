# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with all constitution principles:

- **Code Quality**: Does this feature require new dependencies? Are they justified? Will code pass ESLint/Prettier/Stylelint? Is TypeScript typing complete? Are pre-commit hooks configured? Is code organized correctly in monorepo structure (apps/ vs packages/)? Do package dependencies use workspace protocol?
- **Testing Standards**: What unit tests are required? What E2E tests are needed for user journeys? Are test files properly named and structured? Will tests run via Turbo in monorepo context?
- **UX Consistency**: Does this feature maintain design system consistency? Is i18n required? Are accessibility standards met? Is responsive design considered? If affecting multiple apps, is consistency maintained across UI framework variants?
- **Performance**: What performance impact does this feature have? Are bundle size implications considered? Is lazy loading needed? Are there memory leak risks? Are Turbo build dependencies correctly declared? Is code splitting implemented?

**Status**: [ ] All checks passed | [ ] Violations justified in Complexity Tracking section below

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
